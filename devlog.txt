Research project. Have been working with RSS before, but on the web backed
side.

Mostly used to work with JSON but xml is no problem iOS even have a native
parser. NSXMLParser. Think Iâ€™m going to use that.

Been also been looking at open source third part libraries for RSS parsing but $
small task.

Third party libraries can cause much time them self to integrate properly
so in many cases it takes less time to code it yourself.

Setting up project, setting up git repro.

Implementing xml url parser. For start I extract title and link.  Setting up App Transport Security settings, allowing http connection to dailymail.co.uk.

Problems with feeds not showing up lead me to debugging the parser and finding out that there was problems with line breaks in the xml so I remove all line breaks before populating my item.
