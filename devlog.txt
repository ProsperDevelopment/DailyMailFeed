Reasearch project. Have been working with RSS before, but on the web backed 
side.

Mostly used to work with JSON but xml is no problem iOS even have a native
parser. NSXMLParser. Think Im going to use that. 

Been also been looking at open source third part libarires for RSS parsing but it seams overkill for such a 
small task. 

Third party libararies can cause much time them self to intergrate properly 
so in many cases it takes less time to code it yourself. 

Setting up project, setting up git repro.
